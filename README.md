## games folder

Within the games folder, the game I have made was a simple clicker game, named cookie clicker.py, featuring my shiba plushy (so cute)
Note: you must download the lib package alongside the games package for the game to work!

## discordBot

Simple discord bot that plays music by downloading the mp3 from a youtube url, then plays it in a discord voice channel. I do realize it's really inefficient since there are other bots that play it without downloading, but I didn't really know any libraries at the time.

Also has some text detection capabilities within chat messages (a little bit funny)

## seasonalAnime.py

simple web scraper that once given a year and season, will scrape all the titles of anime in that specificied time period from myAnimeList.com

## novelRip

slightly more complicated web scraper that goes to lightnovelpub.com given a light novel title, and will automatically download every single chapter of specified light novel in .txt files for each. (slightly scuffed text saving however)
